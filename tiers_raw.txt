Tiers
In each tier, the top is the most valuable and the bottom is the least valuable.
Example:
D Tier
Divine Cup  Highest Value
Milk Cup
Icy Cup
Invisible Cup
Blood Cup  Lowest Value

Value Keys
The numbers next to the item/troll are points that estimate their value.
Key:
(value?) = if the points have a ? next to the value, it means the value is unknown or is an estimate.
(value/message) = just a small note about the item/troll.

Values
The Parenthesis go from points, demand, and how stable/unstable it is:


- Stable value means the current value of the item/troll isn't inflated much (which means it most likely wont change.)

- Unstable value means the current value of the item/troll is currently being inflated by a lot (most likely due to being a new item or troll, and has more chances to change).

Example: 
Stone Troll (240, 3/10, Stable), The amount of points (which for Stone Troll it would be 240 points in this case) define what YOU can trade for something. Like Greed Troll (250, 4/10, Stable), which is 250 points, and since both trolls are near in Points and Demand, you could trade for it, this is also called a Fair Trade, or in simpler terms, a F
